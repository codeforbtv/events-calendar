Interactive Calendar
========================

Purpose
-------

Big Heavy World wants its music events calendar to publish information from the State of Vermont's event calendar, filtering the music events onto Big Heavy World and sending event info entered on Big Heavy World to the state calendar. We ultimately want to create an interface that is 'skinnable' and make it available as a tool for other arts nonprofits in Vermont to use, to engage their local communities with the larger pool of information aggregated by the state.
